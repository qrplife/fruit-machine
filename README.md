# Vintage Slot Machine
This program simulates a slot machine like those from manufacturers such as Mills Novelty Company.

The reels simulated are:
* Mills 536-SP-1
* Mills 536-SP-2
* Mills 536-SP-3

Two award payout cards are simulated:
* M108 "Fruit King"
* M102

I've always enjoyed playing mechanical and electro-mechanical slot machines. The trouble for me is that these vintage Mills, Watling, and Jennings type machines fetch north of $4K in good, playable condition. So to satisfy the desire for a vintage "game" of pure chance and not be risking acutal money, I wrote this simple simulation. Naturally it doesn't come close to the full experience of these colorful mechanical marvels, but it does "scratch the itch" a little bit and helps me not go spending my kids education fund on "fruit machines" from the 1930s and 40s.
